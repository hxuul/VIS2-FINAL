    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8;">
      This new page introduces a more specific visualization that explores the relationship between payment types and
      different Australian states. By analyzing payment data at the state level, this visualization aims to provide
      insights into how social service benefits are distributed across various regions.
      Users can interact with the chart to better understand the impact of each payment type, including how certain
      benefits such as Age Pension or JobSeeker Payment may vary significantly from state to state. This breakdown
      allows for a deeper analysis of regional differences and policy effectiveness at a localized level.

        The map above represents the distribution of social service payments across Australian states in 2023. The data
        is normalized, meaning the number of payments is shown per 10,000 people in each state rather than total counts,
        to allow for easier comparison across regions of varying population sizes.
        The darker areas indicate higher rates of payments per 10,000 population, highlighting areas where social
        support services are more widely utilized. Users can select specific states to explore further breakdowns and
        gain insights into the regional distribution of benefits across the country.

        The map on the left illustrates the total social service payments across SA1 regions in Australia. Each region
        is
        color-coded based on the count of payments, with darker shades of green indicating higher payment counts. The
        interactive nature of the map allows users to zoom in and out to view different levels of detail. Additionally,
        users can select different locations, such as major cities, to focus on specific areas. This functionality helps
        to better explore regional distribution patterns, and provides detailed payment information for each SA1 region,
        as seen in the tooltip displaying data for Pearcedale - Tooradin.

        This visualization shows gender distribution (Male and Female) across different Australian states and
        territories based on social service payments. Each pie chart represents the proportion of male and female
        recipients within the selected payment category for regions such as the Australian Capital Territory, Northern
        Territory, Queensland, and others. The gender is color-coded: blue for Female and pink for Male, allowing a
        clear comparison of gender balance in payment distribution. Users can also select different payment types using
        the dropdown for further analysis.
